So, you want to talk about digital footprints? 

What if I said it’s more than the megabytes you’ve shared 

The pixels you downloaded  

The thoughts you’ve published 

 

\What\are\all\the\paths\you’ve\taken\before\?   

How-is-your-mind-networked-with-the-history-of-past-present-and-future-? 

 

Was cyberspace once not just space?  

Land and territory and people 

Were 1’s and 0’s not just two categories 

That once separated  

man and woman  

West and East 

White and Other 

The colonizer and the colonized? 

 

The colonizer traverses across (cyber)space 

Extracting, exploiting, exterminating 

All while armed with a keyboard and mouse,  

Mind formulating algorithms of control

Fingers flipping through the paper he makes  

Code is like a sermon  

Shoved down the throats of those who are willing to eat it  

 

The colonized abandoned in the cloud  

Extracted, exploited, exterminated  

Bodies fed to your datasets  

Souls laced within the fibreoptics of your nation 

Cultures and stories mutilated  

into English that begins in ‘www’

Reparations are not gifted 

But sold in the form of 5 bars and 30 free minutes 

 

Technology and modernity  

A heaven and hell  

Colonialism, postcolonialism, digital colonialism  

A holy trinity cursed with eternal life  

 

Now it’s 2050 

Why can’t you keep up?  

Who said you were a slave to me?   

You are a slave to the computer!  

Why can’t you keep up?  

 

You think 'Data is the new oil?'
No, data is next on the agenda 
of The white man’s burden  
He has conquered the whole world  
Now it is time to conquer the Internet!
